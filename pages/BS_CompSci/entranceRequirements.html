    <h3>First-Year Students</h3>
    <p>
        See the <a href="http://admissions.psu.edu/apply/" target="_blank">Penn State Undergraduate Admissions</a> or <a href="http://hbg.psu.edu/admissions/ugapp.php" target="_blank">Penn State Harrisburg Admissions</a> web pages for information about the application process. You can apply online or request an application form from the web pages. Remember to select Penn State Harrisburg as your campus location. <br /><br />
        Students who intend to major in Computer Science and are admitted as first-year students are placed in a pre-major status called CASCN (or DUS in some cases). 
        These students can enter the Computer Science major (COMP) during the spring semester of their sophomore year by completing the Entrance-to-Major (ETM) process on <a href="elion.psu.edu">eLion.</a>
        Only students who are qualified and eligible at the time of ETM process are considered for COMP major. To be qualified for COMP major at the time of ETM process, a student must:
        <ul>
            <li>have earned a C or better in each of the following courses: MATH 140, MATH 141, CMPSC 121, and CMPSC 122.</li>
            <li>have a cumulative GPA of 2.0 or higher.</li>
        </ul>
    <h3>Transfer Students</h3>
    <p>Admission is open to those students who have completed two years of undergraduate study at a community or junior college, any Penn State campus, or in a baccalaureate program at a four-year college or university. In general, the first two years of studies should be pursued in a baccalaureate degree program. 
    A student holding an associate degree may enter and complete the program successfully; 
    however, additional course work should be expected which may extend the length of the program. 
    The student must have completed a minimum of 60 credits with a 2.0 cumulative grade point average and a GPA of 2.4 in the mathematics and computer science courses. 
    Due to differing backgrounds of entering students, it is possible that a student may not meet all admission requirements. 
    It is possible to fulfill some of these admission deficiencies while taking courses for degree requirement at Penn State Harrisburg.
