    <h1>Integrated Undergraduate Graduate (IUG) Program in Computer Science at Penn State Harrisburg</h1>
    <p>
        The Computer Science program offers a limited number of academically superior Bachelor of Science candidates the opportunity to enroll in an integrated,
        continuous program of study leading to both the Bachelor of Science and the Master of Science in Computer Science.
        The ability to coordinate as well as concurrently pursue the two degree programs enables the student to earn the two degrees in five years.<br /><br />
        As many as 12 of the credits required for the master's degree may be applied to both undergraduate and graduate degree programs.
        A minimum of 50 percent of the courses proposed to count for both degrees must be at the 500 level. Thesis credits may not be double counted.<br /><br />
        Students have the choice of receiving the BS degree at the end of the fourth year or waiting until the end of the fifth year to receive both degrees.
