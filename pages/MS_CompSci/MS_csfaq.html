        <b><a name="nondegree">What if I do not meet the entrance requirements?</a></b> &nbsp;  <br>

        If you do not have all of the entrance requirements necessary for
        admissions into the program, there are two things you might do.  If you
        are missing only a few of the courses necessary to meet
        the entrance requirements (typically 2 or 3),
        you can still apply for admission; however, you will probably be granted
        <a href="#admit">provisional</a> admission.  If you are missing more
        than 4 of the entrance requirements, you are advised to take
        courses as a non-degree graduate student until you have made up
        some of the deficiencies. Taking courses as a non-degree graduate
        student does not require admission to the program.  Some courses taken
        as a non-degree graduate student can <a href="#transfer"> be transferred</a>
        into the program.

    <li>
        <b><a name="close">What if my undergraduate degree is not in Computer Science or a closely related field?</a></b> &nbsp;  <br>

        Another frequently asked question is "Do I need an undergraduate
        degree in Computer Science to apply?".  The answer is no.  However,
        if your previous degree is not in computer science or a closely
        related field, then there will be courses you need to take before
        applying to the program.

        <b><a name="nodegree">What if I do not have an undergraduate degree in any field?</a></b> &nbsp;  <br>

        If you are close to finishing your BS degree, you can be admitted
        provisionally into the MS program pending completion of your BS
        degree.  This is the only exception allowed to the requirement
        that a student have a BS degree from an accredited institution.

        <b><a name="materials">What materials are necessary for admission?</a></b> &nbsp;  <br>

        One of the most frequently asked questions regarding admission
        materials is "Do I have to take the GRE?".  Students are not
        required to take the GRE to apply for admission.  Although the
        department reserves the right to ask a student to take the GRE,
        this is typically not required.

        <b><a name="deadlines"> What are the application deadlines?</a></b> &nbsp;  <br>

        Although the department has no set deadlines for graduate
        applications, there are university deadlines for
        international students.
        <ul>
            <li>
                For fall semester, the deadline is May 31
            </li>
            <li>
                For spring semester, the deadline is September 30
            </li>
            <li>
                For summer semester, the deadline is February 28
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            The Computer Science admissions committee needs time to review your
            application.  Therefore, even though we do not have a deadline for
            applications, we require some time to review applications.
            Typically, once we receive your completed paperwork from the
            admissions office, we can review applications and send letters in
            approximately 2-3 weeks.

        <b><a name="admit"> What is the difference between provisional and full admission? </a></b> &nbsp;  <br>

        If students apply for admission into the program and have not met
        all of the entrance requirements, they may end up with
        provisional admission.  This simply means there are requirements
        the student must meet.  Any deficiencies must be removed during
        the first two semesters of the program if you are a full-time
        student or within the first 15 credits as a part-time student.  Full
        admission to the program depends on your ability to make up the
        deficiencies while maintaining a 2.75 average for those courses.
        The transition from provisional to full-time is typically done
        automatically once the requirements have been met.

        <b><a name="transfer">How do I determine what will transfer into the program? </a></b> &nbsp;  <br>

        You must confer with your advisor about transferring any courses
        into the program.  In general, the following rules apply:

                non-degree graduate credits from a Penn State location and at most
                10 non-degree graduate credits from a non-Penn State location can
                be transferred into a graduate degree program (the actual number is up to
                the program).  This is done by filling out a form available from
                the staff assistant.

        <b><a name="advisor"> Who is my advisor?</a></b> &nbsp;  <br>

        There are basically two advisors for graduate students.  Your
        academic advisor is the faculty member assigned to help you get
        started in the Computer Science graduate program, and particularly to help
        you with scheduling courses, transferring potential courses,
        and making sure that you satisfy degree requirements.
        You should have received a letter with your academic advisor's name
        and contact information when you were accepted into the Computer Science
        graduate program. You should meet with your academic advisor before
        every semester to register for your courses.  Do not simply stop by
        the office and ask for a signature; instead, make an appointment
        and hold a discussion so you and your advisor are both clear on
        your goals.  Included in these discussions with your advisor are:
        your educational goals, your career goals, your scheduling goals,
        potential financial aid, and your background.
        <p>
            After you have started course work, you will need to choose a
            project advisor. This advisor will be the person who helps you with
            your master's project.  Steps on how do choose this advisor can be found
            in the <a href="#project"> "How do I choose a project advisor"</a> section.

    <li>
        <b><a name="sched">How do I decide which classes to take?</a></b> &nbsp;  <br>

        Your academic advisor should always be consulted regarding your
        class scheduling.  There are suggested tracks in the graduate
        program, but students are not required to follow any of these
        tracks.  Students can individualize programs of study provided
        there is advisor approval.<p>
            Once you have selected your project advisor, this advisor will take over
            academic advising duties in addition to helping you with your project
            and defense.

        <b><a name="project"> How do I choose a project advisor?</a></b> &nbsp;  <br>

        Once you decide to begin working on your master's project, it is a
        good idea to talk to all of the Computer Science faculty members.
        When you start your graduate degree, some of you may know exactly
        what you want to do for your project.  However, many of you will
        not.  Therefore, it is very important for all graduate students to
        get to know the faculty.  How can you do this?  There are many
        ways.
        <ol>
            <li>
                Each spring, the department has a graduate open house where
                the faculty members discuss their various research interests and
                potential master's projects.   As a new graduate student without a
                project advisor, you will want to attend this open house.  It will
                give you an idea of what is being done by other graduate students
                in the department as well.

        Your project advisor must be a member of the Computer Science
        Department at Penn State Harrisburg.  Start talking to potential
        advisors early -- it may take longer to find a project than you
        think.
        <p>
            Once you have selected a project advisor, you will need to set
            goals, communicate expectations and establish a timeline for
            completion of your project.  Be sure you and your advisor are in
            agreement about the progression of your education and its
            completion.  You should discuss course work, publication of papers,
            presentations, your defense, meeting times, your graduate
            committee, and all the necessary paperwork for your project and
            graduation.

        <b><a name="standards">What are the standards of academic performance?</a></b> &nbsp;  <br>

        As a graduate student in the Computer Science MS program, you must
        maintain a minimum GPA of 3.0 for course work approved by the program
        taken as a graduate
        student. When a student's grade point average for any semester
        falls below 3.00, he or she should consult with his or her advisor
        immediately. A student whose grade point average drops below 3.00 for
        two consecutive semesters is normally dropped from the program.
        At the 400 and 500 levels, grades of A, B, and C denote graduate credit,
        whereas D and F are failing grades for graduate students.

        <b><a name="fulltime">What is considered full-time for a graduate student?</a></b> &nbsp;  <br>

        To be considered full-time, graduate students must take a
        minimum of 9 credits per semester,  for the fall and spring
        semesters.  The minimum required number of credits for
        full-time status in the summer is 5 credit hours (9 credits
        for financial aid). See
        <a href="http://www.registrar.psu.edu/academic_verifications/enrollment_status.cfm">
            University Registrar
        </a> for information pertaining to enrollment status at Penn State.

        <b><a name="retake">Can I take courses over?  If so, what happens to my GPA?</a></b> &nbsp;  <br>

        Yes, you can take courses over.  However, the original grade you
        receive in the course is not erased from your transcript.  The
        original grade will also contribute to your cumulative GPA.

        <b><a name="defense">What is the master's defense?</a></b> &nbsp;  <br>

        At some point as you are working with your advisor on your
        master's project, you will be ready to schedule your defense
        (oral examination).
        Every graduate student is expected to give a presentation of his or
        her project.  At this presentation, the student will also be expected to
        answer questions regarding the project.
        Your committee members will be present for this defense; other
        faculty members or students may also attend.

        <b><a name="defprep">What do I need to do to prepare for the defense?</a></b> &nbsp;  <br>

        You and your project advisor need to work out a timeline for
        your defense.  There is no specific paperwork to fill out for the
        defense; however, there are some deadlines, so be sure to work
        closely with your project advisor.  Other members of your
        committee need time to review your paper before your defense.
        You should allow at least two weeks for this.

        <b><a name="gradprep"> What do I need to do to prepare for graduation?</a><a></a></b><a> &nbsp; </a> <br>

        The most important thing is to file an intent to graduate to get on
        the graduation list.  Please see the undergraduate FAQ section on:
        <a href="../cs/csfaq.html#grad"> How do I get onto the graduation list?</a><br>
        There is rarely substantial revision to your written paper after
        your defense, but typically there will be some modification
        required to produce the final draft.
