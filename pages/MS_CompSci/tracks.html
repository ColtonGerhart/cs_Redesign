                        <h2>Suggested Tracks for MS in Computer Science</h2>
                        
                        <p>
<br>
For students with interests in the areas of software engineering,
systems programming, and artificial intelligence, the program
suggests the following coursework.  These tracks are only
advisory - there is no requirement that a student follow any
track, and tracks will not be noted on diplomas or transcripts.
<p>
<h3>Track in Software Engineering:</h3>
<p>
Students following the track in software engineering will be
provided with the conceptual tools needed for designing and
managing large software systems.  In addition to the required
core, the track in software engineering consists of the following
courses: 

<p>
<ul>
   <a href="./mscourses.html#513">COMP 513: Formal Methods for Software Engineering</a><br>
   <a href="./mscourses.html#516">COMP 516: Advanced Programming Languages</a><br>
   <a href="http://www.psu.edu/bulletins/bluebook/courses/infsy/570.htm">INFSY 570: Information Systems</a>
</ul>

<p>
In addition to these
courses, <a href="../cs/cscourses.html#470">CMPSC 470: Compiler Construction</a>
is highly recommended, as compiler development
is an ideal environment for gaining practical experience with
software engineering techniques and tools.

<p>
<h3>Track in Systems Programming:</h3>

<p>
Students following the track in systems programming will receive
instruction in both the conceptual foundation of systems software
and the implementation of such systems.  In addition to the
required core, the track in systems programming consists of the
following courses:

<p>
<ul>
   <a href="../cs/cscourses.html#436">CMPSC 436: Communications and networking</a></br>
   <a href="../cs/cscourses.html#438">CMPSC 438: Computer Network Architecture and Programming</a><br>
   <a href="./mscourses.html#517">COMP 517: Computer Security</a><br>
   <a href="./mscourses.html#545">COMP 545: Computer Architecture</a>
</ul>

<p>
<h3>Track in Artificial Intelligence:</h3>
<p>
Students following the track in artificial intelligence are
expected to gain an understanding in the theory and applications
of AI methods as well as evolutionary methods for solving a
variety of problems.  In addition to the required core, the track
in artificial intelligence consists of the following courses:

<p>
<ul>
   <a href="./mscourses.html#520">COMP 520: Advanced Artificial Intelligence</a><br>
   <a href="./mscourses.html#524">COMP 524: Evolutionary Computing</a><br>
   <a href="./mscourses.html#556">COMP 556: Neuronal Computation</a>
</ul>
