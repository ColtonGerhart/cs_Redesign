<h2>Degree Requirements for MS in Computer Science</h2>

<p>
    <b>NOTE:</b> Students entering the program before Fall 2003 can either use the
    <a href="msdegree-old.html">old degree program</a> or the new degree program
    specified below.  All other students must use the new degree program.

<p>
    A total of 30 graduate credits (400 or above) is required for the
    degree Master of Science in Computer Science.
    <a href="http://bulletins.psu.edu/graduate/degreerequirements/masters">
        A minimum grade point average of 3.0 must be earned
    </a>
    for course work approved by the program taken as a graduate student.

    Additionally, students are
    required to complete either a thesis or a paper according
    to one of the two options described below.   Students who
    believe that they have completed a course substantially
    similar to one of the specific course requirements may
    apply to have their previous work evaluated for the
    purpose of exemption to that requirement. If the
    exemption is granted, another approved course shall be
    taken in place of that required course.   The remaining
    18 credits must be completed according to one of the
    following options:
    <ol>
        <li>
            <b>Thesis Option (18 credits)</b><br>
            Research into a specific computer
            science problem, development of a scholarly written
            paper, and an oral defense.  This option requires:

<p>
    <ul>
        <li> 6 credits of <a href="./mscourses.html#600">COMP 600</a>
        <li>
            3 additional credits from approved 500 level electives in
            computer science, mathematics, engineering, and information
            systems courses
        <li>
            9 credits from approved 400 and 500
            level electives in computer science, mathematics,
            engineering, and information systems courses.
            A list of 400 level courses that can be used for graduate
            credit can be found <a href="./ms400courses.html">here</a>.
    </ul>
<p>
    <li>
        <b>Paper Option (18 credits)</b><br>
        In-depth study of a specific computer
        science problem, development of a written paper or
        project, and an oral defense.  This option requires:

<p>
    <ul>
        <li> 3 credits of <a href="./mscourses.html#594">COMP 594</a>
        <li>
            9 credits from approved 500 level electives in computer
            science, mathematics, engineering, and information systems
            courses
        <li>
            6 credits from approved 400 and 500 level electives
            in computer science, mathematics, engineering, and
            information systems courses.  A list of 400 level courses
            that can be used for graduate credit can be found
            <a href="./ms400courses.html">here</a>.
    </ul>
    </ol>

    A maximum of nine (9) transfer credits will be allowed for
    course work completed as a graduate student at another
    institution.
