<h2>Entrance Requirements for MS in Computer Science</h2>

<p>
    An applicant must present a baccalaureate degree in Computer
    Science or a related field from an accredited institution.  While
    a bachelor's degree in Computer Science is not required,
    admission without deficiency requires that an applicant has
    completed the following courses, or approved equivalents.  If
    these courses are not taken before admission to the program, they
    may be taken at Penn State Harrisburg, but the student will
    receive at most 3 credits toward the M.S. degree for these
    courses.

    <br>
    <br>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Design and Analysis of Algorithms
            (<a href="../cs/cscourses.html#463">CMPSC 463</a>)

        <li>
            Operating System Concepts

    </ul>
<p>
    In addition, the following courses are required for admission
    without deficiency.  If these courses or approved equivalents are
    not taken before admission to the program, they may be taken at

    applied toward the M.S. degree.
