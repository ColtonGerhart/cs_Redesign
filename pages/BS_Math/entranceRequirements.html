        Student who intend to major in Mathematical Sciences can enter the major (MA SC) during the spring semester of their sophomore year by completing the Entrance-to-Major (ETM) process on eLion. Only students who are qualified at the time of ETM process are considered for MA SC major. To be qualified for MA SC major at the time of ETM process, a student must:

        Entry to the Mathematical Sciences Secondary Education option requires the following additional requirements:

            <li>a minimum cumulative GPA of 3.0</li>
            <li>completion of ENGL 015 or ENGL 030</li>

    <h3>Transfer Students</h3>
    <p>Admission is open to those students who have completed two years of undergraduate study at a community or junior college, any Penn State campus, or in a baccalaureate program at a four-year college or university. In general, the first two years of studies should be pursued in a baccalaureate degree program. A student holding an associate degree may enter and complete the program successfully; however, additional course work should be expected which may extend the length of the program. The student must have completed a minimum of 60 credits with a 2.0 cumulative grade point average and a GPA of 2.4 in the mathematics and computer science courses. Due to differing backgrounds of entering students, it is possible that a student may not meet all admission requirements. It is possible to fulfill some of these admission deficiencies while taking courses for degree requirement at Penn State Harrisburg.</p>
