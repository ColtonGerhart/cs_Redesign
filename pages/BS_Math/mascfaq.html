        <b><a name="advisor"> Who is my advisor?</a></b> &nbsp;  <br>

        Your advisor is the faculty member assigned to help you make the
        transition into the mathematical sciences program, and particularly to
        help you with scheduling courses and making sure that you satisfy
        degree requirements.  You should have received a letter with your
        advisor's name and contact information when you were accepted into
        the mathematical sciences program.  You can also find out who your advisor
        is by logging in to the <a href="https://elion.psu.edu"> eLion system</a>
        (https://elion.psu.edu) and requesting a degree audit.
        Your advisor's name should appear at the top of your audit.  If this
        does not work, contact the staff assistant (948-6081).

        <b><a name="degree audit"> What is a degree audit?</a></b> &nbsp;  <br>

        The degree audit is a listing of the courses you have taken and how
        they apply to the requirements for the mathematical sciences degree.  The
        degree audit also shows requirements you have yet to satisfy,
        including required courses you have not yet taken and so on.  You can
        request a copy of your degree audit by logging in to the
        <a href="https://elion.psu.edu"> eLion system</a>
        (https://elion.psu.edu).  You can NOT graduate
        unless all of the requirements listed on the degree audit are satisfied.

            </a>
        </b> &nbsp;  <br>

        Your degree audit may contain errors -- courses that do not appear at
        all, or are not listed as satisfying some requirement when they
        should.  In this situation, you should consult with your <a href="#advisor">advisor</a>.
        Your advisor can arrange for changes to be made to your audit if appropriate.

        <b><a name="sched"> How do I decide which classes to take?</a></b> &nbsp;  <br>

        Although you are not required to talk with your
        <a href="#advisor">advisor</a> before selecting courses, it is an
        excellent idea to do so, and will help to prevent unpleasant
        surprises at graduation  time.  Your <a href="#degree audit">degree audit</a>

        <b><a name="soc"> How can I see what classes are offered?</a></b> &nbsp;  <br>

        You can obtain a schedule of classes booklet from Enrollment Services
        (in the Swatara building) or the department office (W255 Olmsted).  You
        can also view all courses offered in the PSU system at
        <a href="http://soc.our.psu.edu/"> http://soc.our.psu.edu/</a>,
        by selecting the appropriate semester, campus location and
        department.  For PSU Harrisburg, the courses are divided into regular
        offerings [campus location "Penn State Harrisburg, the Capitol
        College (CL)"] and courses offered through continuing education
        [campus location "Penn State Harrisburg, CL030"].  Most courses are
        regular offerings.  Courses offered through continuing education are
        mostly lower-level, general-education courses.  We recommend using
        this web page to view the schedule since it is more current than a
        printed schedule, and also shows how many seats are left in each
        class.  You can also use the departmental Information of Local
        interest page at <a href="http://math.hbg.psu.edu/misc/">http://math.hbg.psu.edu/misc/</a>
        for direct links into the schedule of courses web page for math and

        (https://elion.psu.edu).  For any registration method, you will

          At the discretion of the instructor, you may be able to register for a

         instructor, and you will need to fill out an Add/Drop form (sometimes called
         a Schedule Adjustment form).  The instructor will then initial the course
         in question to let you add over the enrollment limit, and then you will
         need to take the form to Enrollment Services (in the Swatara building) to
         register for the course.

            <a name="other school">
                Can I take some classes at another
                university or college while attending PSU Harrisburg?
            </a>
        </b> &nbsp;  <br>
        In general, yes, although you will need to be somewhat careful.  In
        particular, at least 36 of the last 60 credits you take for your degree
        must be taken within the PSU system.  Additionally, you MUST provide a
        transcript (with final grade) for such courses to Academic Records (in
        the Swatara building) so that these courses can be added to your PSU
        coursework.  If you take take classes at another school the semester you
        intend to graduate, you must be able to get such transcripts to Academic
        Records before the end of the PSU semester.  This is a potential problem
        because PSU semesters end earlier than those of many surrounding colleges
        and universities.  Finally, if the courses you take at another school are
        to substitute for required courses or fill a particular graduation
        requirement, you must get approval for these courses from your
        <a href="#advisor">advisor</a>.  If the course taken elsewhere is to
        substitute for a particular required course, you should fill out a
        Prior Approval form (available from the department office), have your
        advisor and the program chair sign it, and then return the form to Enrollment
        Services.

        An Access account is a computer account that is given to every student
        in the PSU system.  An Access account provides Internet access,
        email, access to network resources in the PC computer labs and
        hosting for a personal web page.

        An Access account is automatically created for you when you are

        password for your Access account from any of the lab operators behind
        the desk in the front of the W305 Olmsted building computer lab.   You
        will need a photo ID to pick up your account information.  After you
        have the initial password, you can use it to log in to
        <a href="https://www.work.psu.edu">https://www.work.psu.edu</a>, where you

        We encourage you to use the Sun Lab machines (in W210A and W210
        Olmsted) for all of your programming assignments (although you may
        also program under Windows for most assignments).  The machines run on
        a distribution of Linux (<a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/desktop">Ubuntu</a>) and are useful for general
        purpose computing such as Web development, email, word processing and productivity uses (using
        OpenOffice), and many other tasks.

        also contains instructions for maintaining and accessing a personal
        Web page on the Sun Lab machines.  After filling out the form, you
        can return it to the staff assistant.  Your account will usually be created

        One helpful resource is the local <a href="http://cs.hbg.psu.edu/misc/usage.html">usage guide</a>.
        The book "UNIX in a

        useful reference for anyone who is new to Unix.  Finally, any more

        All of the usual <a href="http://studentaffairs.psu.edu/conduct/">Penn State rules</a> apply, as well as some <a href="http://cs.hbg.psu.edu/misc/ethics.html">additional rules</a> from the Computer Science Program. The <a href="http://cs.hbg.psu.edu/misc/ethics.html">local ethics page</a> has links to the general <a href="http://guru.psu.edu/policies/AD20.html">Penn State computer usage policies</a>.  The short answer is that viewing or altering another user's data without permission is never allowed, and that any commercial use of any Penn State computing resource is prohibited.

        You can access the Sun Lab machines remotely using ssh (Secure Shell) and sftp (secure ftp).  The department does not condone using telent or ftp.  When you use telnet or ftp, your password is sent across the network unencrypted, and so could be intercepted by some malicious user.  <a href="http://cs.hbg.psu.edu/misc/usage.html#access via ssh and sftp">The usage guide</a> contains a list of the hostnames of all of the Sun Lab machines.
